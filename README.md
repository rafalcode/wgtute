# WGCNA official tutorial
... is very tiresome.
an attempt to get it right.

This tutorial works well if you use the "auto" scripts instead of the manual scripts.
In fact it woks pretty badly if you use the manual sets.

One reason for this is the auto scripts label the ME's with numbers instead of colours.

A key major annoyance (in fact throughout WGCNA) is the terminology and how it always seems to be a misnomer.

The Consensus analysis, what is it? It blends and female and male datasets together and therefore calls it "Consensus", however, "combined" would be better.

Included in it is a comparison with the female-only data. THis is a consensus analysis, but it calls it "relating".
